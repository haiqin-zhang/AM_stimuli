Code for generating and running experimental stimuli in the audiomotor piano project.

The stimulus presentation scripts are run in the psychopie environment (requirements coming soon). 
These scripts only take care stimulus presentation and logging MIDI keystrokes.
You need to have the MIDI keyboard plugged in and Ableton running in another window for sound synthesis.



.wav files are recorded at 60 bpm in ableton

The order of melody presentation in the training is:
cd
cde
def
fg
efg
cdef
cdefg

The training phase loops through all files 5 times and takes approx 1 hour to complete
